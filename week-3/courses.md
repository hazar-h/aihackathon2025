# Week 3 — LangChain & LangGraph

This week focuses on **LangChain**, the core framework for building AI-powered systems, and **LangGraph**, its extension for managing complex multi-agent and stateful workflows.

You already know how LLMs and web apps interact, now we’ll explore the frameworks that make it easier to connect data, logic, and intelligence together.

## Goal for the Week
- Cover Langchain Courses
- Team Project

## Overview

| Framework | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **LangChain** | Build and manage modular LLM pipelines (prompts, retrievers, memory, tools). |
| **LangGraph** | Build graph-based, multi-agent systems with control over state, flow, and coordination. |

---

## Use Cases
- RAG pipelines (custom knowledge retrieval)
- Multi-agent workflows (LangGraph)
- Conversational systems with memory
- Tool-using LLMs (API calling, reasoning)
- Workflow orchestration and stateful AI logic
