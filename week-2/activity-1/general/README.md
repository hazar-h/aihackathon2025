## Objective

## Steps

   - A Slack/Teams post.
2. **Make it engaging** by:
   - Adding a clear headline.
   - Stating the benefit for employees/users.
   - Ending with a call-to-action (e.g., “Try it out this week”).
3. **Optional personal touch**: Add one emoji or slogan that makes it more human.
4. **Save** your announcement as Markdown:  
   `internal_announcement_<team>.md`
