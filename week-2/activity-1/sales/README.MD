# Activity: Build a Sales Kit from a Feature Brief (Sales Manager)

## Objective

Turn a simple product/feature brief into a concise **Sales Kit** with:

- A 3-step **outreach email thread** (opener ≤ 80 words + two follow-ups)
- A **discovery question tree** (open → probe → quantify)
- A one-page **battlecard** (ICP value props, objections → rebuttals, proof points)

## Inputs

Provide a short brief that includes:

- **ICP / Industry:** e.g., Mid-market SaaS, HR tech
- **Product/Feature:** e.g., “Dark mode improves nighttime readability”
- **Top 3 Pain Points:** e.g., low adoption after hours, user fatigue, high support tickets
- **Key Outcome:** e.g., higher session duration N%, reduced tickets N%

> Example brief (you can use your own):  
> ICP: Mid-market SaaS product managers.  
> Product: Dark mode for web + mobile app.  
> Pains: low night-time engagement, eye strain complaints, high ticket volume.  
> Outcome: increase nightly active users by 10%, reduce UI complaint tickets by 20%.

## Steps

1. **Write a 3-step email thread**
   - Step 1 (Opener, ≤ 80 words): personalize by ICP and pain point; include 1 metric-oriented outcome and a clear CTA.
   - Step 2 (Follow-up #1): add a new angle (risk/impact or social proof).
   - Step 3 (Follow-up #2): create urgency (timeline, quick audit, or shared resource).
2. **Create a Discovery Question Tree**
   - Level 1: open questions to surface context (current KPIs, stakeholders).
   - Level 2: probing questions to clarify scope (volumes, workflows, blockers).
   - Level 3: quantification questions (baseline metrics, $$ impact, timeframe).
3. **Draft a Battlecard (1 page)**
   - ICP value propositions (3 bullets, each tied to a pain).
   - Top objections (3) → crisp rebuttals (3).
   - Proof points (3): metrics, case snippets, relevant benchmarks.
4. **Save** your kit as Markdown: `sales_kit_<team>.md`
